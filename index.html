 <center>For my final I would like to introduce you to Genshin Impact</center>

<center>Genshin Impact was introduced to me by my friend one day and what kept me 
playing was the amazing music featured in the game. I loved the amazing world
and lore and the way the music follows the story with every country and 
every unique character and the gods who rule over them.</center>

 <br><center> Genshin Impact is a popular action role-playing game developed and published by the Chinese game development studio miHoYo. It was released in September 2020
for various platforms, including PC, PS4, IOS, and Android. The game is set in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven distinct nations, 
each with a corresponding element and God.</center>
<center>Players take on the role of the "Traveler", a mysterious figure who embarks ona quest to find their long lost sibling and unravel the secrets of Teyvat. The game features and open world struscture with an expansive and visually stunning enviornment, offering players the freedom to explore various regions, solve puzzles, and engage in combat.</center>
<center>One of the notable features of Genshin Impact is its elemental system, where characters and enemies are associated with different elements such as Anemo(wind), Geo(earth), Electro(electricity), Dendro(grass), Hydro(water), Pyro(fire), and Cryo(ice). Compbining different elemental abilities strategically can lead to powerful synergies in both exploration and combat.</center>
<center>The game also incorporates a gacha system for acquiring new characters and weapons, encouraging players to collect a diverse roster of characters, each with unique abilities and playstyles. Genshin Impact has gained widespread popularity for the stunning visuals, engaging gameplay, and regular content updates that introduce new characters, storylines and challenges to keep players entertained.</center></br>
 <center>Genshin Impact is a game that ticks all the boxes and is a game that is one for everyone as far as it is explained by Ernest H. Lindley. The game completes multiple of the "why we play" readings and is one of the few games in my opinion that has something for everyone. The game has a wide arraw of puzzles and mentally difficult things to do while also giving the "pleasure in satisfaction of instinct, pleasure in vigorous activittyt and pleasure in joy." Genshin Impact is an incredible game that comes with difficult challlenges, character and account progression as well as a vast world to explore and conquer while also featuring endgame content gacha gambling, all which bring satisfaction to the players and give them a reason to come back.</center>

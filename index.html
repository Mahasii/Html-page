 <title>MUAG 4200 FINAL</title>
<br>For my final I would like to introduce you to Genshin Impact</br>


 
<br>Genshin Impact was introduced to me by my friend one day and what kept me 
playing was the amazing music featured in the game. I loved the amazing world
and lore and the way the music follows the story with every country and 
every unique character and the gods who rule over them.</br>
